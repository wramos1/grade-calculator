# Grade-Calculator

As a person who has experienced teachers/professors locking their grades, I decided to build a project that calculated your grade based on categories, 
their weight percentages and your grade percentage in those categories.

As there are multiple grade calculators out there, I couldn't be sure that they actually worked so I built my own.
I took time to research the formulas that are used to calculate grades and verified that the formulas were correct by using real people's grades. 

When professors lock their grades during times of high stress for students such as midterms or finals, it produces even more anxiety. This tool was
built to help those and myself to reduce that stress. 

I also utilized this tool to get more practice using Local Storage because users would likely want to check
back in to verify their grades throughout the school year.
